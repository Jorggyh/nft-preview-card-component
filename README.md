## My process

I started developing the mobile part, then I just adjusted it to desktop using media query, I realized that I could deal
with images in two ways, using two different images in HTML with the `picture` tag or in CSS as background, I chose
the second option.

The same can be said of the shopping cart image inside the button, I put it with CSS, using
the `before` pseudo-element.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This effect of hovering the mouse over the image, and an icon appears with a half-transparent background color was new
to me, I had never done it before, it was interesting to find out how to do it.
